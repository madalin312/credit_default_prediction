Credit Default Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I analyze a credit default dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, and build predictive models using various machine learning algorithms.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will default on a credit payment based on various features. The dataset is preprocessed and then used to train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Extra Trees.
